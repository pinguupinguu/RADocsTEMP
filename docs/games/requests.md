- 1 request at 10000, 15000, and 20000 points.
- 1 request for every 10000 points from 20000 to 180000 points.
- 1 request for every 20000 points from 180000 onward.

!!! Warning "Important Note!"

    Requesting a set for a game is by no means a guarantee that it will get one any time soon!
	
### Using Requests

If a game entry does not have an achievement set, it will have an option to request a set, which is located under the screenshots and game info.
