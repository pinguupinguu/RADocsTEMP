## Before you Begin

### 1. Are you free of tickets?

Before working on a new you must address all open tickets you have. Once you're free of tickets, then go ahead.

### 2. Is the game present on the database?  

#### No

Then ask for it to be added on Discord **#help-me** or on our forums and some dev will add it for you. It's essential you [choose the right ROM(s) to work with](Working-with-the-Right-ROM). If you want to work on a ROM hack, check the [achievements for ROM hacks](Achievements-for-ROM-hacks) doc first.

#### Yes

Good! Go ahead.


### 3. Does the game already have an achievement set?  

#### Yes

If there is an existing set, don't give up. You can still improve it, by adding/removing/reworking achievements, or make changes to titles and images, etc. However you'll need to go through the [set revision process](Achievement-Set-Revisions).

#### No

Look deeper. Often there are multiple entries in the database for the same game under different titles. Once you're sure, you'll need to check if there's another dev working on the game.

**Note:** Only one achievement set is allowed per game per console. For details see [working with the right ROM](Working-with-the-Right-ROM).


### 4. Is another developer working on the game?

To be sure if there's another dev working on a game, check the game's official forum topic (that's the official way to [reserve a game to work on](Developers-Code-of-Conduct#reserving-a-game-for-achievement-development)). This is needed to avoid conflicts between multiple devs working on the same game.

#### Yes

It may be possible that developer has stopped working on it. Developers are expected to renew their reservation every three months. Look at the time stamps to see when the developer posted a reservation for development. If the developer has not stated or renewed their reservation on the game after three months you can assume it has been abandoned and then you can post your plans to work.

#### No

Great! You're free to go ahead! The next step is to announce your plans to develop achievements for the game.
