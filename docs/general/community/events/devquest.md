## What are DevQuests?

They're achievement development-related quests that developers can take part in at any time. Each one has a specific goal and upon reaching that goal, the achievement developer will earn the badge. 

## General Rules
- All work done for for DevQuests must adhere to the Developer CoC. 
- Put effort into what you do. Submitting shoddy work for the sake of getting a badge ASAP will result in penalties that could lead to disqualifications. 
- All sets submitted for DevQuest must be full sets. **No progression-only!**
- By default, hacks, homebrews, prototypes, unlicensed, and subsets do not count. Exceptions vary per DevQuest and will be explicitly stated.
- Be respectful and responsible. The overall point to DevQuests is to improve existing work as well as generate new content. Let's stick to that.
- DevQuests do not stack with each other, but may stack with other events such as The Unwanted, Challenge League, or Daily DistRActions. So far, the only exceptions are DevQuest 004 - Veteran Developer and DevQuest 015 - Console Conqueror.

## Reporting
- DevQuests that involve making new sets are generally reported by contacting QATeam on site or on Discord. 
- If a DevQuest has a specific contact point, they will be stated. 

## Schedule and Announcements
- DevQuests do not have a specific release schedule. Typically, they are announced shortly after their badge has been completed. 
- New DevQuests and any updates to existing DevQuests will be announced in `#developer-news` on the RetroAchievements Discord and site news

|![DQ02](/general/community/events/images-devquest/DQ02.png)|**002**|**[Summer Set Repair](https://retroachievements.org/game/15957)**<br>*(Badge-Based)*|**Repair 3 sets from provided batch**<br>• Upon selecting a game, you will be presented with a list of repairs that need to be made for the set<br>• This DevQuest follows standard revision procedures<br>• Resolve any open tickets for achievements that are kept in the set.

They *will* be checked.<br>• These do not require a revision vote since it is only tightening logic<br>• Achievements cannot be your own; you should fix those anyway!|
|![DQ04](/general/community/events/images-devquest/DQ04.png)|**004**|**[Veteran Developer](https://retroachievements.org/game/15947)**<br>*(Achievement-Based)*|**This DevQuest consists of several passive goals, each one being their own achievement, which are as followed:**<br>1. Has published at least 1000 achievements and worked on at least 25 sets as the sole or majority developer<br>2. Has created achievements for at least ten different console IDs<br>3. Has been an active developer for at least **two** years<br>4. At least 85% of sets have dynamic rich presence *(Vet Dev I required)*<br>5. Yielded unlocks have exceeded 50,000<br>6. As a sole developer, submitted one or more sets for code review and received an overall grade of at least 20<br>7. Has used at least 75% of all currently available flags and features (Vet Dev I and VI required)8. Has obtained at least two DevQuest badges<br>•*Note: A constantly evolving toolkit means that these requirements are subject to change at any time*|
|![DQ05](/general/community/events/images-devquest/DQ05.png)|**005**|**[Trigger Happy](https://retroachievements.org/game/15952)**<br>*(Badge-Based)*|**Update 20 sets with the Trigger and Measured flags**<br>• They need to actually make sense<br>• You can do your own sets, but each one counts as half a set.|
|![DQ06](/general/community/events/images-devquest/DQ06.png)|**006**|**[The Unwanted](https://retroachievements.org/game/15907)**<br>*(Badge-Based)*|**Develop a set for an unpopular system assigned to you at random**<br>• Eligible systems: PC Engine, PC Engine CD, Sega CD, 32X, Atari Lynx, Neo Geo Pocket, Neo Geo Pocket Color, Game Gear, Atari Jaguar, Virtual Boy, MSX/MSX2, SG-1000, Apple II, Saturn, 3DO, ColecoVision, Intellivision, Vectrex, PC-8800, Atari 7800, WonderSwan, and WonderSwan Color<br>• No hacks or homebrew unless those are the only types of games left without sets.<br><br>**There are two ways to be able to re-spin:**<br>1. If your selected console is Atari Jaguar, Sega 32X, or Sega Saturn. The first two are fairly problematic to dev for and the last is a resource hog that many people have trouble running just to play, much less dev to set<br>2. If your claim expires or you drop your claim. The penalty for dropping a set is still having to wait until the claim would have expired before getting a re-spin. For example, if you claim a set on September 1st and drop it on November 1st, you'll still need to wait until December 1st before the re-spin. You can only do this once|
|![DQ07](/general/community/events/images-devquest/DQ07.png)|**007**|**[Most Wanted](https://retroachievements.org/game/17758)**<br>*(Badge-Based)*|Develop a set for one of the most requested games.

Unlicensed titles may count as long as they are not blatant bootleg ports or hacks of another game. If you're unsure then ask!<br>• If a game was released in English on another platform with RetroAchievements support, half credit may be granted. Games that only released in English on unsupported platforms will receive full credit.|
|![DQ09](/general/community/events/images-devquest/DQ09.png)|**009**|**[Launch Party!](https://retroachievements.org/game/15937)**<br>*(Badge-Based)*|Develop a set for a newly supported console within 6 months of RA support<br>• PSP window: 2021-10-01 through 2022-04-01<br>• Dreamcast window: 2022-02-12 through 2022-08-12|

|![DQ11](/general/community/events/images-devquest/DQ11.png)|**011**|**[The Genesis of RA](https://retroachievements.org/game/1280)**<br>*(Badge-Based)*|Develop a set for the Mega Drive/Genesis to celebrate the anniversary of RA's first achievement<br>• Must be either full sets or a major/significant revision<br>• Sega CD and Sega 32X games are not eligible.<br>• Neither are those Sega 32X CD games (nice try!)<br>• If you already have one claimed, you must be under 50% progress for it to count<br>• Collabs are allowed so long as the work is visibly split.|
|![DQ12](/general/community/events/images-devquest/DQ12.png)|**012**|**[Hacker's Habit](https://retroachievements.org/game/672)**<br>*(Badge-Based)*|Create two new sets for robust hacks.<br>• Sets intended for this quest must be complete and encompass all notable content specific to the hack.<br>• Acceptable hacks must be either complete overhauls that drastically change the level design, or introduce new mechanics that greatly change how you progress through the game.<br>• Meme hacks, single-level hacks, and other small modifications aren't eligible.<br>• You're limited to one hack per franchise. As an example, if you create a set for an SMW or Mega Man 2 hack, you can't make a second one for SM64 or Mega Man 3.

Some examples:<br>- For Arcade-type games it is fine to just add High Score leaderboards, possibly highest in a single life<br>- For Racing games time trials for tracks are pretty standard<br>- Speedruns for Platformers<br>- Minigames that track high scores or time are good candidates<br>- And so on. Reach out if you have any questions about a specific game<br>• You can do your own sets for half-credit as long as they were published prior to this DevQuest (2022-03-02)<br>• Please leave comments on set page for what you added for log purposes|
|![DQ15](/general/community/events/images-devquest/DQ15.png)|**015**|**[Console Conqueror](https://retroachievements.org/game/809)**<br>*(Achievement-Based)*|**Publish a set for every supported console on RetroAchievements**<br>• Each console ID will have an achievement associated with it. Newly supported console IDs means new achievements!<br>• Contact us to opt-in to being tracked for this. There will generally be no need for reports.<br>• The only requirement for an unlock is that you are the sole or majority developer of a set on that console ID. An even split in collabs will count if you have at least 20 achievements in the set. <be>• As a **last resort**, cases where there are no games left to make a full set for or you'd be scraping the bottom of the barrel, you can still unlock the achievement for that console ID by having and/or obtaining at least 3 points in the dev-related tasks below (please note that past work will be factored in):<br>*- 2 Points - <50% dev of a set*<br>*- 2 Points - Got at least 10 achievement badges to pass the icon-gauntlet*<br>*- 2 Points - Resolved at least 5 legitimate tickets*<br>*- 2 Points - Made at least 5 leaderboards*<br>*- 1 Points - Made dynamic RP for at least 5 sets*<br>*- 1 Points - Got a new game icon to pass the icon-gauntlet*<br>*- 1 Points - Spelling/Grammar corrections in titles/descriptions*<br>*- There will additional ways to earn these points in the future to ensure these do not become missable! Could be anything from hash identification, patch creation, writing guides, tagging, etc. Let us know if you have suggestions!*<br>• This DevQuest is 100% retroactive! Potential future revisions of your work will not count against you, so no worries about losing eligibility for an unlock.|
