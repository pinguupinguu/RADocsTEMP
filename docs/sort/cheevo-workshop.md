# The Cheevo Workshop
_This page is a work in progress. Guidelines are not final; we're still getting kinks worked out._

## Details

The Cheevo Workshop is an ongoing open achievement development project where anyone can get involved and everyone has a say in the creation of a chosen game's achievement set. The goal of the project is to promote collaboration between developers, help jr-devs raise their proficiency, motivate former/retired developers into becoming active again by taking on smaller roles, and to encourage users to try out achievement development. 

If you are not a developer, you can still contribute by submitting ideas, designing badges, testing for bugs in unofficial, etc. 

If you wish to participate in the workshop, request the `@workshop` role from an admin or a mod. 

## Rules
* One set at a time!
* Adhere to the [Developer's Code of Conduct.](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/docs/wiki/Developers-Code-of-Conduct)
* The game picked for each workshop cannot be reserved by a developer at the time it is chosen.
* Do not make yourself hard to work with. Go into the workshop with an open mind.
* Do not get greedy about credit and do not try to 'hog the set.' Once contribution credits are implemented, they will be put to good use here. In the meantime, specific credits will be stated on Discord and the game's forum thread.
* When and if you decide to participate, announce how you'd like to contribute and present your findings and progress. This is to prevent participants from overlapping on tasks. This is especially important for tasks where overwriting someone else's work can occur (i.e. code notes). 
* A set lead should be voted on by workshop participants.
* The set lead is responsible for maintaining a development schedule (aka due dates). 
* MIA users should not stall a set's progress. 
* This is **not** a competition. Use the workshop to build a good set, to help others, and to learn.

## Workshop Checklist
This is a general road map for a set's development cycle when being developed by the workshop. Whenever a step of the Workshop Checklist is underway, it should be represented in the topic of the `#workshop` channel.

### 1. Voting
This is when a game undergoing the workshop treatment is decided on. 
* Announcements should be made in the `#community-news` channel and pinging the `@event-news` role.
* The first ten suggestions will be put up for a vote. 
* Polls can be submitted in the `#poll-me` channel for the widest reach. 
* Allow a 24-hour voting period, but do not use timed polls until ghost voting can be dealt with. 
* Be sure to research each game, mostly to see if a set has already been reserved or not.

### 2. Team Building, Research, Digging, Planning
Once a game has been selected, the workshop can begin their work immediately. The following should take place during this step:
* Form a team. Someone may request to be the set lead to guide the development process. If there are disputes on who is the set lead, a vote among workshop participants shall decide who ultimately gets the role. 
* Edit the game page to make sure all information, screenshots, box art, etc. are accurate.
* Set reservation on the game's forum thread. This post is to be made by [CheevoWorkshop](https://retroachievements.org/user/CheevoWorkshop), so it will require an admin's approval. Participants should be listed. An example of a CheevoWorkshop post can be found [here.](https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=5995&c=48703)
* Check gamefaqs, tcrf.net, gamehacking.org, YouTube, etc. Present any interesting discoveries that can be utilized for the achievement set.
* Take turns finding memory addresses and values for anything that's noteworthy. "Taking turns" should be stressed here. Announce on the `#workshop` channel that you will be doing some RAM digging and also announce when you finish or are taking a break. This will allow others to resume digging without saving over any of your findings.
* As a group, brainstorm a potential achievement list. These can be kept track of by using Google Sheets, an up-to-date pinned message, etc. 
* Check to see if design ideas are possible. 

### 3. Set Development
Once an achievement list is created and a sufficient amount of addresses have been found, actual set development can occur. Consistency is very important here. **Please note that nothing should be uploaded to Unofficial during this step.**
* The set lead may split the set up among the participating developers. 
* Agree on logic that is used.
* Achievements should be tested locally. Issues that arise should be discussed in the `#workshop` channel. This will inform other participants of potential issues as well as lead to possible solutions.

### 4. Final Draft, Information, Protection, Badges
* Agree upon and post a final draft of the achievement plan.
* If applicable, decide how to split up the uploads into unofficial. A lot of 'obvious' achievements such as progress and collectibles can be split up between participants. The easiest way to do this is to split them up evenly, but if there's any left over, they can be uploaded by the CheevoWorkshop user or set lead. 
* Come up with names, descriptions, and badges for each achievement.
* Properly allocate the points.
* Add password, cheat, and/or save protection.
* Add leaderboards and/or rich presence.

### 5. Unofficial, Testing, Fixes
* Push the set to Unofficial. 
* Help each other test the achievements and find holes in the logic. Asking for volunteers who will play differently than the developers is not 100% necessary, but desirable.
* Improve stability. 
* Editing another user's work must be announced beforehand with a screenshot of the work you intend to edit and why the edit is necessary.
* Verify alternate hashes, harmless hacks, etc. 

### 6. Core, Tickets, Feedback, Cooldown
* Push the set to core and make an announcement.
* Whoever takes credit for an achievement will be responsible for potential tickets. Be sure to fix them. Announce fixes in `#workshop` in cases the fixes would apply to achievements uploaded by other users.
* There should be a cooldown period after each set. This is to deal with any initial tickets and to discuss potential submissions for the next workshop.

## Other Information

* This is the bot command that was used for the first poll (note there are only 8 because there were only 8 legit suggestions):

`!poll 'Please select one of the following for the workshop:'
'Pokemon Trading Card Game 2 (GBC) - <https://retroachievements.org/game/3692>'
'Kirby Tilt n Tumble (GBC) - <https://retroachievements.org/game/709>'
'Gekido Advance - Kintaros Revenge (GBA) - <https://retroachievements.org/game/7217>'
'Devil World (NES) - <https://retroachievements.org/game/4759>'
'James Pond - Underwater Agent (Mega Drive) - <https://retroachievements.org/game/2449>'
'Yu-Gi-Oh! Dungeon Dice Monsters (GBA) - <https://retroachievements.org/game/5537>'
'Glover (N64) - <https://retroachievements.org/game/10309>'
'ToeJam and Earl in Panic on Fonkotron (Mega Drive) <https://retroachievements.org/game/806>'`

* An evolving badge is planned for all participants. The badge will detail how many workshops a user has participated in.
