### Site update
1. Untracked status has been added as a possible user status. Untracked players do not show up in the global ranking. Instead of banning players who are found to be cheating they can be given the status of untracked. Also players who don't want to show up in the global rankings can also request this status, given by admin.

### Emulators Update [v0.067]
*For RANes, RAGens, RAVBA, and RASnes9x*

#### Developer Changes 

**Memory Inspector:**

1. You can now scroll with your mouse-wheel in the memory viewport. 
2. The memory viewer cursor no longer defaults to line 5, instead you are allowed to move it within a current viewport freely. 
When you move past the top or bottom the view will scroll up or down and keep the cursor position on the top most or bottom most line. 
3. In the memory viewport hitting page down will go down 1 page depending on how many addresses you have in view. Previously it would only go down 5 lines. 
4. In the memory viewport while selecting an address from the "Watching" it will put the selected address in focus on the center of the viewport relative to the length of the viewport. 
5. While putting values into the Mem Viewport you can wrap around the right side instead of getting stopped at 0xf of that line. This allows for quicker corrupting, which can sometimes be useful for finding addresses. 
6. When deleting a note in the Mem Viewport the selected stays at current address instead of going to 0x0. 
7. Notes window has been extended to 5 from 3 lines. 
8. Notes window now has word wrap and accept line returns greater than 3. 
9. View Notes Button has been added below Delete. 
10. Memory Search Range has been added allowing for Custom Range System RAM and Game RAM. 
11. Searching for hex values in Given Value is allowed with the prefix 0x. 

**Achievement Editor:**

1. "Clone selected" achievement has been replaced with "Copy" and "Paste" buttons. 
You are now able to copy and paste multiple selected requirements within an achievement, to an alt group or to another achievement! 
2. "Delete Selected" will now delete ALL selected achievements instead of just one at a time.(edited) 

**Rich Presence:**

1. No longer displays "Unknown". It just leaves a blank non-space. Devs this means you don't need to sweat as much about about those knowing every value state of an address in RPS. 
2. If someone is playing a set without achievement or a Rich Presence script it the Rich Presence will say "Playing [game name]".
