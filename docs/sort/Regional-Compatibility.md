### Adding Regional Compatibility

If you would like to add support for another region (e.g. adding support for a European ROM when the set was made with the USA ROM) to a set, please note the following:
* For the majority of consoles, PAL-region games run at 50hz whereas NTSC runs at 60hz. Without a 60Hz patch, some achievements could be easier to obtain due to the decreased frame-rate. This is especially important for achievements that use frames-as-time in their logic and for leaderboards in general.
* Some regions have different cheats. There are many cases where cheat codes were altered or removed upon localization. These should be accounted for. 
* If there are enough differences between versions, an entirely separate set might be the best option. For more information on this, please see [localization differences](https://docs.retroachievements.org/Working-with-the-Right-ROM/#localization-differences).
