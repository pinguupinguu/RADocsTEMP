You can (and should) be as creative as you can, but there are some concepts that are typically **NOT** welcome for achievements, such as:

1. Requiring Glitches/Bugs [^1] (acceptable in specific [Subsets](/developers/subsets)).
2. Requiring input from two or more players (acceptable in specific [Subsets](/developers/subsets)). 
3. Requiring perfection through the entire game (acceptable in specific [Subsets](/developers/subsets)).
4. Playing poorly for no meaningful purpose. Exceptions to this include "Bad Endings" or when the game itself ties significance to such actions.
5. NSFW content in text or badge.
6. Achievements popping frequently with little effort from the player (including multiple achievements for doing the same task, such as one for beating a boss and another one for getting the item left by the boss, etc.)
7. Achievements obtainable with zero effort for no meaningful purpose (example: start the game as character X, collect one coin, watch a video). It's acceptable if there's something fun/historical/interesting you want to address.
8. Require excessive repetitive grinding, such as reaching level 99 in an RPG, for no meaningful purpose (**maybe** acceptable in [Bonus Sets](Bonus-Sets)).
9. Rely entirely on randomness, especially when there are extremely low odds. However, for games where the randomness is a major aspect, it may be appropriate.
10. "Secret Achievements", where the players have no indication of what they're going after. If you want to prevent spoilers give at least a clue on the Achievement Title/Description. Otherwise the players will start to search on web or mess with Achievement Editor/Memory Inspector, and in the process they can stumble across even worse spoilers.
11. Sets for games that lack gameplay (videos, music visualizers, jukeboxes, etc.) won't be accepted without explicit approval. Approval will be handled via a vote by the QATeam on the Discord server, and requires implementation of sufficiently creative concepts. Book sets are still allowed, but must be worth 0 points. Example: SporyTike's GBA Video Series was presented with the idea to include a leaderboard quiz at the end of each episode. This unique plan involved gameplay past pressing start and was approved.
12. Sets for compilations featuring games that share the same console as the compilation. An example of this is 6-Pak for Genesis/Mega Drive, which contains six Genesis/Mega Drive games.
13. Prototypes/Beta sets if there is no discernible unique content from the main game. (This is just an extension of the demo rule).

[^1]: Glitches/Bugs are errors within a game's code which often cause unintended behavior. Examples are memory overflow, incorrectly loaded levels, and clipping into objects.

**Note**: With every rule, there are exceptions. This is especially true with unwelcome concepts. All unwelcome concepts have some wiggle room, so when in doubt, ask.
