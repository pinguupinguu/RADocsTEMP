## Developing a new achievement set

Before you begin working on a new achievement set go through the [new achievement set checklist](/guidelines/new-achievement-set-checklist).

#### 1. How to Reserve
The only way to reserve a game is claiming it on the specific game page, as explained [here](https://retroachievements.org/viewtopic.php?t=17176).

- No other declarations, plans or lists posted anywhere else are to be considered in this.
- Code notes do not reserve a game (if you have added notes but not reserved the game in the forum, any other developer is free to work on it).
- It is recommended that you post a list of planned achievements, so the community can review your work and give you feedback.

#### 2. Concurrent Reservations Limit

As in the maximum number of achievement sets one developer can have reserved at once.

- **Junior Developer**: 1
- **Developer**: 4
- *Note:* Joining another developer in a cooperative effort does not reduce from this total.

#### 3. Reservation Timing

- Only reserve a game for development when you start working on it. In other words, do not reserve games just to block others from working on it.
- Please reserve a set as soon as you begin working and not as you are finishing your work.

#### 4. Reservation Renewals

You can renew your reservation every three months if you have not finished your set.

- Once a reservation has expired, the set is available to be claimed by another developer. 
- Once a reservation is more than a year old, a detailed progress report will be required for any subsequent renewals. The report should provide an overview of the development situation and include details such as:
1. Memory digging status
2. Rich Presence and Leaderboards Status (if applicable)
3. List of planned achievements
4. List of achievements already coded (local or unofficial)
5. Progress of badges creation
- The reports will be reviewed by the Developer Compliance team, who will decide whether the progress is sufficient to warrant another renewal.
- If the renewal is denied, a cooldown of 1 month will be applied and after this period the developer will be allowed to reserve the set again if it is available. Detailed progress reports will be required for any further renewals.
- If a claim is dropped and resumed in less than a month, the initial claim date before dropping the set will be mantained.

#### 5. Respecting Reservations

- Do not ask, pressure or discourage anyone from working on any game, in public or in private (of course, assuming the person is already following all other standards on this Code of Conduct).

#### 6. Reservation Cool-Down

Upon reserving a set, wait at least 24 hours before promoting it to core. This allows time for reservation review and to clear up any possible reservation disputes. If you believe a set is ready for core within 24 hours, an early promotion may be subject to approval.

### Important Notes

- If you post a complete plan, be open to suggestions; you can get excellent input and suggestions this way.
- You must adhere to the [Achievement Set Requirements](/guidelines/achievement-set-requirements/), otherwise your set won't be allowed.
- **When you publish your work you are giving it over to the community to be reviewed and reworked over time.**

#### Collaboration

- Let others know if you welcome collaborators.
- If you've recently reserved a set and someone else voices desire to work on a set that you've reserved within the last 24 hours (beyond suggesting ideas), consider ways in which you can collaborate with them.
- If someone reserved a game you're interested in before you, don't get frustrated. You are encouraged to request collaboration. You can post your desire to collaborate in the forum or send them a message to get permission from them to publish your contributions. You can also wait and [revise the set](/guidelines/revision-guidelines/) after the set is published.
