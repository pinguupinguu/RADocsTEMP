This section covers developers' rights, responsibilities, and rules for fair play.

**If you are not a dev, check [how to become a developer](/development/how-to-become-an-achievement-developer/).**
  
**See Also**: [Users Code of Conduct](/guidelines/users/user-coc.md).

## Golden Rules

1. Respect your fellow developer and communicate through any issues you have civilly.
2. Make room for other developers to get a chance to work on games they like, in their own way.
3. Anyone can become a developer if they put in the effort.
4. All achievement sets are open for improvement.

## Achievement Ownership

**When you publish your work you are giving it over to the community** to be reviewed and reworked over time - see [Revision Guidelines](/guidelines/revision-guidelines/). 

While the original developer does not own published achievements they are still the caretaker in terms of bug fixing and maintenance. If another developer revises the achievement they are the new caretaker of that achievement.

## Feedback about the Developer Code of Conduct

Although the Developer Code of Conduct is the result of an intense debate, it's not an immutable document. If you have suggestions for improvements, contact us on our Discord server or send a message to [RAdmin](https://retroachievements.org/user/RAdmin).
