This document covers developers' rights, responsibilities, and rules for fair play.

**If you are not a dev, check [how to become a developer](/development/how-to-become-an-achievement-developer/).**
  
**See Also**: [Users Code of Conduct](/guidelines/user-coc).

## Golden Rules

1. Respect your fellow developer and communicate through any issues you have civilly.
2. Make room for other developers to get a chance to work on games they like, in their own way.
3. Anyone can become a developer if they put in the effort.
4. All achievement sets are open for improvement.


## Developers must do the following to keep in good standing:

- When planning to work on a new game, reserve it by [announcing your plan to work on it](#reserving-a-game-for-achievement-development) in a new post specific for that purpose.
- Only announce new plans when you are [free of unaddressed tickets](#handling-tickets).
- Keep your work free from [unwelcome concepts](/guidelines/unwelcome-concepts).
- Use [protective code](#every-achievement-set-must-have), preventing potential cheating and exploits.
- Leave accurate [code notes](#code-notes) for each achievement condition you use.
- For set revisions, follow the [revision policy](Achievement-Set-Revisions).
- [Resolve tickets](#handling-tickets) and leave notes each time you do.
- Like a wiki, once you publish your work, you are giving it over to the community to be [reviewed and reworked over time](#achievementset-ownership).

## Developing a new achievement set

Before you begin working on a new achievement set go through the [new achievement set checklist](/guidelines/new-achievement-set-checklist).

## Reserving a game for achievement development

#### 1. How to Reserve
The only way to reserve a game is by clearly stating your goal to create achievements in the official forum topic of the game on a new post exclusive for that purpose.

- No other declarations, plans or lists posted anywhere else are to be considered in this.
- Code notes do not reserve a game (if you have added notes but not reserved the game in the forum, any other developer is free to work on it).
- It is recommended that post a list of planned achievements, so the community can review your work and give you feedback.

#### 2. Concurrent Reservations Limit

As in the maximum number of achievement sets one developer can have reserved at once.

- **Junior Developer**: 1
- **Developer**: 4
- *Note:* Joining another developer in a cooperative effort does not reduce from this total.

#### 3. Reservation Timing

- Only reserve a game for development when you start working on it. In other words, do not reserve games just to block others from working on it.
- Please reserve a set as soon as you begin working and not as you are finishing your work.

#### 4. Reservation Renewals

You can renew your reservation every three months if you have not finished your set.

- To renew a reservation, simply state that you are still working on a game in the its official forum topic. This must be a new post specific for that purpose; editing your previous declaration is not a valid renewal.
- After renewing a reservation for a third time, a detailed progress report will be requested for each subsequent renewal. 
- Avoid locking down a set indefinitely. If it appears a developer continues to delay development on a set with little or no progress, staff may intervene. If that happens the renewal of reservation will not be authorized for a period of 3 months. After this period, the developer will be allowed to reserve the set again if it is available.
- Once a reservation has expired, the set is not available to be claimed by another developer until an admin has stated in the forum topic that the set is open for development. If you feel the declaration was overlooked, please contact [RAdmin](https://retroachievements.org/user/RAdmin). 

#### 5. Respecting Reservations

- Do not ask, pressure or discourage anyone from working on any game, in public or in private (of course, assuming the person is already following all other standards on this Code of Conduct).

#### 6. Reservation Cool-Down

Upon reserving a set, wait at least 24 hours before promoting it to core. This allows time for reservation review and to clear up any possible reservation disputes. If you believe a set is ready for core within 24 hours, an early promotion may be subject to approval.

### Important Notes

- If you post a complete plan, be open to suggestions; you can get excellent input and suggestions this way.
- You must adhere to the [Unwelcome Concepts](/guidelines/unwelcome-concepts), otherwise your set won't be allowed.
- **When you publish your work you are giving it over to the community to be reviewed and reworked over time.**

#### Collaboration

- Let others know if you welcome collaborators.
- If you've recently reserved a set and someone else voices desire to work on a set that you've reserved within the last 24 hours (beyond suggesting ideas), consider ways in which you can collaborate with them.
- If someone reserved a game you're interested in before you, don't get frustrated. You are encouraged to request collaboration. You can post your desire to collaborate in the forum or send them a message to get permission from them to publish your contributions. You can also wait and go through an [Achievement Set Revision](/guidelines/revision-guidelines) after the set is published.

## Handling Tickets

**After you've published achievements be prepared for bug reports.**

You're expected to keep your work bug free by appropriately resolving tickets. Respond to all tickets as soon as possible. The sooner you respond the better, cause the problem is fresh in the player's mind and you can use them to help you to resolve the problem.

While resolving tickets, leave a brief summary of what you did. If you have an indication of false report leave a message showing what conclusions you've made, and then close the ticket. **Closing/Resolving a ticket without leaving any comments is an unwelcome attitude.**

Do not declare your plans to work on a game if you have unaddressed tickets. A ticket is considered as addressed when the developer acknowledeged the ticket, commented on it explaning the situation but is unable to resolve the problem immediately due to reasons such as waiting for saves states or more information from the reporter.

If you want to resolve tickets or fix bugs on achievements made by another developer, it's always a good practice to try to contact them and check if they are still active before changing their work. **An inactive developers is someone who have have 10 or more open tickets that are older than two months** (you can see their open tickets from the Ticket Manager).

If the developer is active, you can assist them in the resolution.

If the developer is inactive you can freely resolve their tickets. However you're only allowed to fix the achievement to match the description; **do not change the intention of the achievement without going through the revision process**.

If a fellow developer has already started to handle a ticket thru action that can be proved with comment of intent, leave it to them. The user would be given a time of 7 days to handle the ticket after comment. Example: If `USERA` was fixing a ticket (having left a comment of intent) and then `USERX` came to undo the work or interrupt the work in progress this would be an issue.

## Editing Leaderboards

1. Before making updates to a leaderboard,  you must backup each modified conditional line on the comment (if too long use Pastebin link)
2. After editing a leaderboard, if you are fixing, adding, or removing entries, you must leave a comment about changes you have made and why.
3. A leaderboard's concept/design should not be changed once players have begun submitting entries. Exceptions are as follows:

    A. If a leaderboard has a bug in which a correction would result in a discrepancy between between pre and post fix LB submissions, this would be considered a fundamental change and it may be most appropriate to "retire" the leaderboard and create a new corrected LB.

    B. If a protection needs to be added to the cancel field in a leaderboard, for example to eliminate point farming/leaching (Areas where a game generates an endless number of things, such as items, money, or enemies), it may be preferable to either “retire” or create an additional leaderboard. "Retiring" a leaderboard means preventing future submissions.

4. If a developer wishes to create a new concept for a leaderboard, a new one should be added.

5. If a developer wants to implement a fundamental change to a leaderboard while keeping it intact, a revision vote is required. “Fundamental changes” involve the following:

    A. Changes to how players submit scores.

    B. Changes to submission requirements that impact difficulty and or strategy.

6. A Jr. Developer may only change, add, or remove a leaderboard with a code-reviewer that goes through the revision process with them.


## Developer Status Extended Inactivity

If a developer is inactive for six months or longer, meaning within six months they have not created any new achievements or resolved any incoming tickets, their developer status will expire.

If this happens to you, you are very welcome to come back to the scene if you want to create new content for our community. First you'll want to review and understand this document (the Developer Code of Conduct). When you feel ready to adhere to it, message us to user [RAdmin](http://retroachievements.org/createmessage.php?t=RAdmin) (a shared admin mail account) here on site or speak to the admin or mod users on the [RetroAchievements Discord server](https://discord.gg/dq2E4hE) to check how to get your developer status back.

## Achievement Ownership

**When you publish your work you are giving it over to the community** to be reviewed and reworked over time - see [Revision Guidelines](/guidelines/revision-guidelines). 

While the original developer does not own published achievements they are still the caretaker in terms of bug fixing and maintenance. If another developer revises the achievement they are the new caretaker of that achievement.

## Feedback about the Developer Code of Conduct

Although the Developer Code of Conduct is the result of an intense debate, it's not an immutable document. If you have suggestions for improvements, contact us on our Discord server or send a message to [RAdmin](https://retroachievements.org/user/RAdmin).
