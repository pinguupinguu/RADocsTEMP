RABot is the the official RetroAchievements Discord robot. Therefore, to interact with him, you need to be a member of the [RA Discord server](https://discord.gg/dq2E4hE).

RABot has many cool and useful commands and in this page you'll see some examples of how some of them can be used.

RABot is powered by [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) and [Commando](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/commando/master/general/welcome).

**Special thanks**: the [DragonFire's Xiao bot](https://github.com/dragonfire535/xiao/) is a great source of inspiration for many of the cool commands we have in RABot, like [`!bulbapedia`](#bulbapedia), [`!manga`](#manga), [`!translate`](#translate), [`!define`](#define) and others.
