# RADocsTEMP

I'm starting to open this up a bit and making the RADocs overhaul a priority. The point of this repo is to eventually replace RADocs. You can contribute by cloning/forking this repo so you can run a local instance of the new RADocs. You will need to have mkdocs and material installed. Changes will not be made by deploying changes in the wiki; they will be made with PRs. Everything will be coordinated via the issues and repo projects. 

I'll add more info and detailed instructions soon.
